# AmazonGiftCard
paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.amazonGiftCard=To pay with an Amazon eGift Card, you must send an Amazon eGift Card to the BTC seller using your Amazon account.\n\n\
  Please see the wiki [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Amazon_eGift_card] for further details and best practices.\n\n\
  Three important notes:\n\
  1. Try to send gift cards with amounts of 100 USD or less, as Amazon is known to flag larger gift cards as potentially fraudulent.\n\
  2. Use text in the gift card message which does not carry risks to get flagged (e.g. do not use Bisq or Bitcoin). Then share the exact reference text with your trading peer in the trade chat so they can verify your payment.\n\
  3. Amazon eGift Cards can only be redeemed on the Amazon website where they were purchased (e.g., a gift card purchased on 'https://www.amazon.it' can only be redeemed on 'https://www.amazon.it').

# Bizum
paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.bizum=To use Bizum, you need a Spanish bank account (IBAN) \
  and must be registered for the service.\n\n\
  1. Bizum can be used for trades between €0.50 and €1,000.\n\
  2. The maximum amount you can send or receive with Bizum is €2,000 per day.\n\
  3. Bizum users are limited to a maximum of 150 transactions per month.\n\n\
  Individual banks may apply stricter limits within these maximum values.\n\n\
  Please also consider your personal account limits. If you exceed any of the above limits, the trade may be cancelled and a penalty could apply.
paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.cashByMail=How to send cash by mail?\n\n\
  1. The BTC buyer must package the cash in a tamper-evident cash bag.\n\
  2. The buyer should film or take high-resolution photos during packaging, with the recipient address and tracking number already attached.\n\
  3. The buyer must send the package with delivery confirmation and appropriate insurance.\n\
  4. The BTC seller should film the package opening, ensuring the tracking number is clearly visible.\n\n\
  Rules:\n\
  - The offer maker must state any special terms in the **Additional Information** field.\n\
  - By taking an offer, the taker accepts the maker’s stated terms.\n\
  - Cash by Mail provides limited verifiable evidence, making disputes difficult. Funds may remain locked until both peers reach an agreement.\n\
  - Losses from Cash by Mail trades are NOT eligible for reimbursement by the Bisq DAO.\n\n\
  To fully understand the requirements, please read the Bisq wiki at: [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Cash_by_Mail].

paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.cashByMail.headline=Instructions and rules
paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.cashDeposit=Please ensure that your bank allows cash deposits \
  into other people’s accounts.\n\n\
  Many banks no longer support deposits to a foreign account.

paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.f2f='Face to Face' trades follow different rules and carry different risks than online transactions.\n\n\
  Key differences include:\n\n\
  1. Trading peers must exchange meeting location and time details using their provided contact information.\n\
  2. Both peers need to bring their laptops and confirm **“payment sent”** and **“payment received”** at the meeting place.\n\
  3. If a maker has special **terms and conditions**, they must state them in the **Additional information** field.\n\
  4. By taking an offer, the taker agrees to the maker’s stated **terms and conditions**.\n\
  5. In case of a dispute, mediators or arbitrators can offer limited help, as it is usually difficult to provide \
  tamper-proof evidence of what happened at the meeting. In such cases, BTC funds may remain locked until both peers reach an agreement.\n\n\
  To fully understand Face to Face trades, please read the instructions and recommendations here:\n\
  [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Face-to-face_(payment_method)]
paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.headline=Background information

paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.pix=There are five types of Pix keys:\n\n\
  * CPF (Natural Persons Register)\n\
  * CNPJ (National Registry of Legal Entities)\n\
  * E-mail address\n\
  * Telephone number\n\
  * A random system-generated key called a universally unique identifier (UUID)\n\n\
  A different key must be used for each Pix account you have. Individuals can create up to five keys per account they own.\n\n\
  When trading on Bisq, BTC buyers should include their Pix Key in the 'payment reason' so sellers can identify the payment.

# SBP
paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.sbp=The Faster Payments System (SBP) is a Russian \
  inter-bank transfer service that allows personal payments using only a mobile phone number.\n\n\
  1. SBP supports transfers between Russian bank accounts in Russian Rubles only.\n\n\
  2. Only Russian mobile numbers with the +7 country code can be registered.\n\n\
  3. You must create a separate Bisq account for each bank where you want to receive funds.\n\n\
  4. SBP shows the receiver’s first name, middle name, and last-name initial for verification. Enter the account owner’s name in Bisq in the same format.

# Halcash
paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.halCash=With HalCash, the BTC buyer sends the withdrawal code to the BTC seller via SMS.\n\n\
  Please check your bank’s HalCash limits before trading.\n\
  Typical limits are:\n\
  1. Minimum withdrawal: €10\n\
  2. Maximum per withdrawal: €600\n\
  3. Daily limit: €3,000 per receiver\n\
  4. Monthly limit: €6,000 per receiver\n\n\
  Withdrawals must be in multiples of €10. Bisq will adjust the BTC amount accordingly, so market-based pricing cannot be used.\n\n\
  In case of a dispute, the BTC buyer must provide proof that the EUR was sent.

#IMPS
paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.imps=Please note that IMPS transfers are limited to Rs. 200,000 per transaction.\n\
  If you trade above this amount, multiple transactions will be required.\n\
  The daily limit is Rs. 1,000,000.\n\n\
  Some banks may apply lower limits for their customers.

paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.ifsc=IFSC Code
paymentAccounts.ifsc.invalid=IFSC code format must be: XXXX0999999 (e.g. SBIN0001707)
# Zelle

paymentAccounts.createAccount.accountData.backgroundOverlay.zelle=Zelle is a money transfer service that works best *through* your bank.\n\n\
  1. Check whether (and how) your bank supports Zelle: [HYPERLINK:https://www.zellepay.com/get-started]\n\
  2. Pay close attention to transfer limits—banks often set separate daily, weekly, and monthly sending caps.\n\
  3. If your bank does not support Zelle, you can still use the Zelle mobile app, but limits will be much lower.\n\
  4. The name on your Bisq account **must** match the name on your Zelle/bank account.\n\n\
  If you cannot complete the Zelle payment exactly as specified in the trade contract, you may lose part or all of your security deposit.\n\n\
  Because Zelle carries a higher chargeback risk, sellers are advised to contact new buyers via email or SMS to confirm they own the account.
