reputation.buildReputation.headline=Build reputation
reputation.buildReputation.intro.part1=Bisq Easy's security model relies on the seller's reputation. This is because during a trade the buyer sends the fiat amount first, \
  therefore the seller needs to provide reputation to establish some level of security.\n\
  A seller can make and take offers up to the amount derived from their reputation score.\n\
  It is calculated as follows:
reputation.buildReputation.intro.part1.formula.output=Maximum trade amount in USD *
reputation.buildReputation.intro.part1.formula.input=Reputation score
reputation.buildReputation.intro.part1.formula.footnote=* Converted to the currency used.
reputation.buildReputation.intro.part2=To trade the minimum amount of 6 USD *, sellers need to have at least a reputation score of 1200.

reputation.burnedBsq.info2=That will be determined by the competition of sellers. \

reputation.accountAge.info=By linking your Bisq 1 'account age' you can provide some level of trust. \
  There are some reasonable expectations that a user who has used Bisq for some time is an honest user. But \
  that expectation is weak compared to other forms of reputation where the user provides stronger proof with \
  the use of some financial resources.
reputation.accountAge.infoHeadline2=Privacy implications
reputation.accountAge.info2=Linking your Bisq 1 account with Bisq 2 has some implications on your privacy. \
  For verifying your 'account age' your Bisq 1 identity gets cryptographically linked to your Bisq 2 profile ID.\n\
  Though, the exposure is limited to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' which is operated by a Bisq contributor who has set up a \
  BSQ bond (bonded role).\n\n\
  Account age is an alternative for those who do not want to use burned BSQ or BSQ bonds due to the financial \
  cost. The 'account age' should be at least several months old to reflect some level of trust.
reputation.accountAge.score.headline=Impact on reputation score

  The mediator has no enforcement power and can only try to assist in finding a cooperative resolution. In case of clear violations \
  of the trade rules or scam attempts the mediator can provide information to the moderator to ban the bad actor from the network.\n\

  In case the provided information is sufficient to verify a rule violation the moderator can ban that user from the network.\n\
  In case of severe violations of a seller who had earned some sort of reputation, the reputation becomes invalidated and the relevant source data \
  (like the DAO transaction or account age data) will be blacklisted in Bisq 2 and reported back to Bisq 1 by the oracle \

  This is essential at the very fist start as at that moment the new user has no persisted data yet for connecting to other peers.\n\
  It also provides P2P network data like chat messages to the freshly connecting user. \
  That data delivery service is also performed by any other network node, though as seed nodes have 24/7 availability and a high level of quality of \
  service they provide more stability and better performance, thus leading to a better bootstrap experience.\n\
  Seed node operators from Bisq 1 can become Bisq 2 seed node operators without locking up a new BSQ bond.
