academy.bisq.subHeadline=Bisq na free and open source software wey dey allow you exchange Bitcoin with Fiat currencies or other crypto-currencies for decentralized and trust-minimized way.
academy.bisq.exchangeDecentralizedHeadline=Exchange, decentralized
academy.bisq.exchangeDecentralizedContent=Bisq na application for exchange where you fit buy and sell Bitcoin for national currencies or other cryptocurrencies. Unlike plenty other exchanges, Bisq na both decentralized and peer-to-peer.\n\nE dey decentralized because e no depend on any single company, team or government. Decentralization make Bisq one strong network: just like Bitcoin, e dey exist because of users like you. Since e no rely on one thing, e dey hard for anybody to stop or harm the network. E dey peer-to-peer because each trade wey you do, e deymatch you with another user like you. This one dey help you protect your privacy from centralized things likegovernment and traditional financial institutions. E still make Bisq permissionless: you no need anybody permission to use am, and nobody fit stop you from use am.\n\nRight now, we get two applications: Bisq 1 and Bisq 2. Bisq 2 na the application wey you dey read this. We advise you make you sabi Bisq 2 well before you wan learn more about Bisq 1.
academy.bisq.whyBisqHeadline=Why Bisq
academy.bisq.whyBisqContent=For many users, Bisq na the preferred way to buy or sell Bitcoin in exchange for national currencies. This na because Bisq get different experience from Centralized Exchanges.\n\nUsers like Bisq because e dey respect their privacy. You no need provide any personal information to use Bisq. Anytime wey you dey trade, you only need share your payment details with your trade partner. Nobody else fit access this data, and no central database dey where your information and transactions go dey stored for years or decades.\n\nBisq still allow users bypass any kind of permission wey their local government or financial institutions fit impose on them. Examples of this fit be governments wey declare Bitcoin possession or trading as illegal, or banks wey no allow customers send their own money to exchange institutions. Users wey dey these kind situations find for Bisq way wey dem go use do what they wan do without being excluded from the traditional financial system for any reason.\n\nFinally, Bisq na safe way to exchange Bitcoin and national currencies. The existing trade protocols and reputation systems dey prevent bad actors from steal your funds. Mediators dey always available to support you anytime another peer no behave well, and dem fit step in to find solution for your case. The result: Bisq users fit trade with others without fear say dem go scam dem and collect their money.
academy.bisq.tradeSafelyHeadline=Trade safely
academy.bisq.tradeSafelyContent=Exchanging your Bitcoin and national currencies with other peers comes with great benefits like not depending on companies or protecting your privacy. But you might be wondering: how can I know if the peer I'm trading with is honest? Won't I get scammed? Those are valid concerns that you should always keep in mind and that Bisq addresses in several ways to allow safe trading.\n\nThe different trade protocols (you can think of a protocol as the rules you and your peer will have to follow) minimize the risk of any actor scamming their peer during a trade. There is usually a trade-off between security and convenience: some protocols are more robust, others are more convenient and fast. It is up to you to decide which protocol to use on each trade, depending on your preferences and needs, as well as the traded amount. Protocols like Bisq Easy are recommended for small sums of money, while more robust and structured protocols like Bisq Multisig are advisable for larger amounts.\n\nIf your trade ends up in a conflict with your trade peer, or the peer simply disappears and becomes unresponsive, you will not be left alone. Mediators and arbitrators are always available to advice and provide solutions in these situations. These roles will observe each case, propose friendly solutions between the traders, and potentially make final decisions if no agreements are reached. If you have acted honestly and followed the rules, the outcomes will be in your favor and you will never lose your funds.\n\nIn summary, Bisq is designed to minimize the need for trusting other peers and to discourage scamming and other bad behaviors. This translates in very few trades having any kind of conflict, and those which do will always be solved in a reasonable way through mediation and/or arbitration. The result: trading in Bisq is a safe and smooth experience.

## Bitcoin
######################################################

academy.bitcoin.subHeadline=Na peer-to-peer electronic cash wey allow make online payments go directly without middlemen.
academy.bitcoin.whatIsBitcoinHeadline=Wetin Be Bitcoin
academy.bitcoin.whatIsBitcoinContent=Bitcoin na the biggest and most popular cryptocurrency for the world. E be digital cash wey allow anybody send value to other people without needing any middleman. E start for 2009 and e don grow well well since that time, e gain acceptance across the world because of e unique properties.\n\nBitcoin different from all the national currencies for plenty ways. Bitcoin no dey controlled or issued by any government or institution. E dey decentralized, and e dey exist because of the thousands of people across the world wey dey use am. This one make am neutral money, where nobody dey any special position to take abuse am. E still mean say you free to use Bitcoin without needing any kind permission, and nobody for the system get more power pass you. E be open system wey welcome everybody. Another important property be say you fit hold Bitcoin by yourself without needing any other company or entity. If you compare am with traditional currencies, e dey more like the cash wey dey your pocket (wey you get control) pass e be like balance for bank account (wey you dey subject to the bank's conditions and wishes). Because of this, you dey free anytime to send Bitcoin: you no need anybody approval to do am, and your transactions no fit be stopped or reversed. Another interesting aspect be say Bitcoin supply na limited to 21 million maximum. This one mean say the value of each bitcoin, unlike the value of each dollar for example, no fit dey reduced by creating more of am. Bitcoin dey create through one costly process wey dem dey call mining, and the amount wey fit dey created and the emission schedule dey strictly defined and no fit be modified. This one mean say the supply dey limited, certain, and predictable, and e make Bitcoin attractive because of e scarcity and robustness.
academy.bitcoin.whyUseBitcoinHeadline=Why Make You Use Bitcoin
academy.bitcoin.whyUseBitcoinContent=Bitcoin properties make am one unique asset wey dey attract different people for different reasons. How Bitcoin take attract you dey depend on your profile and needs.\n\nOne of the most common reasons wey people dey use Bitcoin na e ability to protect value over time. The national currencies for plenty countries for the world dey lose value continuously over time because of currency debasement. This one mean say as you dey hold your savings for cash or bank account, you dey lose them because their value dey reduce over time. Bitcoin limited supply no dey allow this one happen, so even if e dey behave anyhow for short term, e still be strong tool to preserve your wealth for long term.\n\nAnother reason why individuals dey use Bitcoin na to protect themselves from government and financial institutions actions and decisions. Since Bitcoin na something wey you fit own, send, and receive for permission-less way, the value wey dey inside am no go dey affected by situations like central bank wey dey print more units of their national currency, or bank wey decide to block your transfers for any reason, or government wey dey do confiscations on top their population. With Bitcoin, the rules of the game dey well-known and predictable, and you fit dey sure say the network go dey fair and treat everybody equally.\n\nBitcoin still dey attractive for those wey dey engage for international trade and wan send or receive money to other countries or regions. Bitcoin no get concept of borders and e dey work the same whether you wan send some to your neighbor or to person for the other side of the world. Since making payments to people or companies for different regions of the world usually dey involve long waiting times, high fees, and plenty paperwork, some people dey choose Bitcoin as one simple and convenient alternative for their cross-region payments. E still mean say you fit use am send money to countries wey your government or bank don decide to block.\n\nLastly, some people dey choose Bitcoin because e dey simple and convenient. Bitcoin get plenty advantages for this area when you compare am with traditional currencies. With am, you no need deal with contracts and long bureaucratic processes to do simple things like open account. You fit easily access your money for all your devices. You fit send am anywhere and to anybody without needing different forms of payment (cash, bank transfers of different sorts, credit cards, etc.). You fit easily protect and secure your funds with the right knowledge, and you no go worry about person wey go steal your wallet or credit card details.\n\nBitcoin na big and innovative step forward for the world of money and payments. E sure say there dey one reason why Bitcoin fit attract and fit useful for your needs, so we encourage you make you learn more and become familiar with am.

## Security
######################################################

academy.security.subHeadline=Make sure say na only you fit access your funds all the time
academy.security.introContent=Because Bitcoin dey work different from national currencies, the precautions wey you need to take dey different from wetin you sabi before. This one na very important topic because, even though Bitcoin give you plenty power and freedom, e also dey make you responsible for how you go take protect your funds. So, you suppose spend small time and effort to sabi how to secure am well.\n\nWhile security na complex topic, we fit break am down into three main goals: make sure say other people no fit access your private keys, make suresay you always fit access your private keys, and avoid to mistakenly send your bitcoin to scammers and other people wey you no trust.
academy.security.securingYourKeysHeadline=Secure your keys
academy.security.securingYourKeysContent=Firstly, you must sabi one simple idea: no be your keys, no be your coins. This one mean say, for you to truly own your Bitcoin, e suppose dey stored for one wallet where only you get control of the keys. So, if you dey keep Bitcoin for banks or centralized exchanges, e no be you truly own the asset because na those entities get control of your funds, no be you. If you really wan own your bitcoin, you suppose store am for wallet wey only you get control of the keys.\n\nPlenty Bitcoin wallets dey available, and each oneget e unique design and features. Wetin all of them get in common na say somehow, somewhere, dem go store your private keys. These keys na the ones wey go give you access to your funds. Any wallet wey you use, you suppose make sure say only you, or people wey you fully trust, get access to these keys. If another person get access to the keys, e fit steal your funds, and nothing fit fit undo the transaction. On the other hand, losing the keys yourself bad well well. If you lose your keys, you no go fit send your funds again, and nobody fit help you recover am. Even though this one fit sound like wahala, you fit easily avoid these kind situations if you learn small and you follow good practices.\n\nMost Bitcoin wallets go give you one backup wey consist of 12 or 24 words, wey people dey call mnemonic phrase or seedphrase. This backup na the most important thing for you to secure because e fit allow you restore your wallet for any device. E go dey better make you store these backups for analogical form, usually by writing am for paper or for small metal sheet, and make sure say you get different copies of am. You still suppose store am for place wey you go fit see am if you need am, but nobody else suppose fit access am.\n\nFor big amount of Bitcoin, e dey common to use specialized devices wey dem dey call Hardware Wallets to store your keys. These devices offer better security when you compare am to storing your keys for smartphone or laptop wallet, and dem still make am easy when e reach transaction. You fit learn more about these and other types of wallets for the Wallets section of Bisq Learn.\n\nLastly, make sure say you no dey use storage plan wey too complicated. One storage plan wey get plenty details and subtleties fit chase thieves comot from your funds, but e get chance say you no go fit access your own wallet because of mistakes, confusion, or simply because you forget how you arrange the backups. Aim for one balance between setup wey dey too simple (like storing your seedphrase for plain text file for your laptop's desktop) and setup wey dey too complex wey even you self no fit figure out (like storing the words of your seedphrase for 12 books for 12 different places).
academy.security.avoidScamsHeadline=Avoid scams
academy.security.avoidScamsContent=Another source of problems and risk na scams. Bitcoin transactions no fitfit reverse, so if person deceive you make you send am Bitcoin and e run go, nothing go fit happenabout am. Because of this, e common well to see different schemes wey people go try deceive you make yousend am Bitcoin. Most times, scammers go give you better "opportunity" wey go make you make money easily,and this opportunity go too dey good to be true. The specific stories and details for these scams plentywell well, but the common pattern na say dem go show you better returns, but first, you go need send Bitcoinfirst. Once you send the Bitcoin, you no go likely see am again. To protect yourself from these scams,just dey interact with reputable and trusted companies and people. If you dey feel say one entity no dey straight, make you ask for references or waka comot from there. If dem give you opportunity wey too good to be true, e probably be scam, and e better make you stay far from am.


######################################################
## Privacy
######################################################

academy.privacy.subHeadline=Your data na your own. Keep am like that.
academy.privacy.introContent=To keep your financial information and identity private dey common among Bitcoin users. E dey natural and make sense say you no go wan make other people sabi about your funds and transactions without your permission. After all, you no fit waka for road dey wear t-shirt wey get your bank account balance and credit card reports, abi you go fit?\n\nPrivacy na important topic for Bitcoin because the way way Bitcoin transactions and addresses dey transparent dey make mistakes for this area fit cost you well well. For this section, we go cover some points about privacy for your Bitcoin journey.
academy.privacy.whyPrivacyHeadline=Why privacy dey relevant
academy.privacy.whyPrivacyContent=Many users value the freedom that Bitcoin provides them to own their property and transact freely and without permission with others. But without good privacy practices, these features of Bitcoin get seriously eroded. Disclosing information about yourself and your Bitcoin funds will put you at risk of several kinds of attacks from others that will restrict your own freedom. Reflecting on what data you are sharing and being mindful of this will prevent you from making costly mistakes that you might regret down the line.\n\nThe first obvious issue with revealing your identity and details about your funds is personal safety. If someone knows details such as how much bitcoin you hold, where you live, and what kind of wallet you are using, they could easily plot a physical attack against you in order to get hold of your keys. This is especially tempting in comparison with national currency bank accounts, since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Thus, if a thief manages to force you to send your bitcoin to an address of their own, or just steals your wallet keys and does so himself, there will be no way to cancel that transaction and your bitcoin won't be yours anymore. Keeping your identity and financial details private prevents you from becoming a target of this kind of attack.\n\nAnother good reason to keep your details private is the danger posed by hostile government regulations and actions. Governments throughout the world have repeatedly taken actions against their citizens' private property in various ways. A great example of this is Executive Order 6102, which made it illegal for US citizens to hold gold and caused a unilateral confiscation of gold for millions of US citizens. Just like with regular thieves, ensuring that government entities and personnel hold no information about you and your funds protects you in case the government starts a negative policy against owners of Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, you probably just don't want others to know how much Bitcoin you hold or what transactions you perform. Just like we protect our bank accounts with various methods so that only we can check our balances and movements, it makes sense to ensure others don't have the ability to view the transactions and their details, such as when, how much, or with whom we transact.
academy.privacy.giveUpPrivacyHeadline=How we dey give up our privacy
academy.privacy.giveUpPrivacyContent=Many ways dey wey person fit voluntarily or mistakenly disclose personal details. Most times, e easy to prevent am with common sense, because many times, na just by being careless e dey happen. Some subtle leaks go require small technical knowledge and time. But the good news na say, with small effort,you fit avoid the most important issues.\n\nThe biggest privacy mistake, because of how often e dey happenand how terrible e be, na to give out your ID voluntarily when you wan buy or sell Bitcoin. Nowadays, many centralized exchanges (companies like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, etc.) dey follow government KYC regulations (KYC mean Know Your Customer). This one mean say, government dey force these companies to ask for your passport,national identity card, driver's license, or similar documents so that dem fit link this information to your account. From the moment wey you give these documents, every purchase and sale wey you do go dey recorded and linked to you. Plus, the exchange and government agencies go dey see your balance anytime. Even if you decide say you wan carry your Bitcoin commot from these exchanges and keep am for wallet wey you get control,these people go fit track the addresses wey your funds dey go. And if this one no dey give you worries, there still another wahala: if any hacker gain access to the databases of these companies, dem fit leak your information go public for the internet, wey go allow anybody for the world to sabi all your personal and financial information. This one don happen many times for the past few years, and e get serious consequences for some customers wey these exchanges affect.\n\nAnother area wey you suppose dey careful na address re-use. Every time wey you give person the address of your wallet make e send you some bitcoin, this person go sabi say this address belong to you. This one mean say, from that time, the person fit dey monitor the address and everything wey happen inside. If you dey reuse this address over and over, every person wey you dey interact with go fit see the different transactions wey dey that address, including when dem happen, where the funds dey come from and go, and the amount wey dem dey transact. So e better make you dey use addresses to receive bitcoin just once. Most wallets go dey take care of this one for you, but e still dey important make you sabi why e good like that.\n\nLastly, to dey rely on other people's nodes to read blockchain data fit mean say the person wey run the node fit dey monitor the addresses wey your wallet dey interested in. When you dey handle significant amount of Bitcoin,e go dey make sense if you learn how to run your own node and connect your wallet to am. Or at least, make sure say you dey careful about the node wey you wan connect to and choose one from person or organization wey you trust,like your friend wey sabi Bitcoin well or the local Bitcoin community.
academy.privacy.bisqProtectsPrivacyHeadline=Bisq dey help protect your privacy
academy.privacy.bisqProtectsPrivacyContent=Bisq allow you buy and sell Bitcoin from other people. This simple difference get plenty advantages when you compare am with using centralized exchanges when e reach privacy. If you use Bisq, e go protect your safety and privacy from government, companies, and other people wey wan record and use your data against your interest.\n\nWhen you dey transact for Bisq, na only you and your peer sabi the details of the transaction. And even between both of una, the information wey una suppose share dey very small and e dey restricted to the necessary payment details, like, for example, your bank account number if you wan receive fiat payment for your bank account. This one mean say you no need provide information like your ID, address, etc. Again, the way wey you fit interact with different peers on every trade dey prevent one person from gathering data about you with time, and e dey distribute your transaction history among different people, and e dey prevent any one person from fit see your full financial life. Bisq also allow you receive any bitcoin wey you buy directly for address of the wallet wey you get control, wey e enable you get control of your funds at all time, and e give you the chance to distribute am across different addresses so that no single person fit dey monitor your wallet.\n\nRemember say, Bisq na just software wey dey run for your computer, and e dey connect to the internet through privacy friendly networks like Tor and I2P. You no even need to sign up somewhere for pseudonymous way. Because of this, nobody fit sabi say you dey use Bisq, and your communication with other participants no fit dey monitored, tracked or accessed by third parties.


######################################################
## Wallets
######################################################

academy.wallets.subHeadline=Picking the right tools to handle and secure your bitcoin.
academy.wallets.whatIsAWalletHeadline=What is a wallet
academy.wallets.whatIsAWalletContent=Wallets are your tool to perform the most fundamental actions in Bitcoin: receiving it, storing it and sending it. Since Bitcoin is an open system, anyone can build a wallet for it, and many different ones exist. This is great because it means you have plenty of different options in the market from which to choose, and you can even use multiple different wallets to cover different needs.\n\nGenerally, a wallet is a piece of software that does several things for you: it reads the blockchain to check the balance of the addresses you control. It can build and send transactions when you want to pay someone else. And it holds your keys so that you can sign your transactions. Some of these features look different in different wallets, and some wallets only cover parts of them. To understand this better, it's useful to be familiar with the different characteristics that make wallets different from each other.\n\nFirst, you should understand the difference between a hot wallet and a cold wallet. A hot wallet is a software wallet where the keys that control your bitcoin are stored on an internet-connected device. A cold wallet, on the other hand, is a setup where your keys are stored on a device that is never connected to the internet, and you use a different software to track your balance and prepare and send transactions. Hot wallets are typically a simple app on your phone or laptop. A cold wallet, on the other hand, means you use a software in your phone or laptop that does not hold your keys, and you combine that with a second device that holds the keys and never connects to the internet. This second device could be a dedicated laptop or smartphone, or more commonly, a hardware wallet. Hot wallets are simpler to manage and use, but they are also less secure. Cold wallets require a slightly more complex and cumbersome setup, but offer a much higher degree of safety against hacks and mistakes when handling keys. How to handle the risks of managing your funds is a personal decision, but it is generally recommended to use hot wallets like your traditional wallet for bills and coins in your pocket, and cold wallets like a safe box in a bank. You wouldn't carry a million dollars in your wallet. And you wouldn't use the contents of your safe box to pay for a coffee.\n\nHardware wallets are special physical devices that are designed and manufactured with the sole purpose of storing the keys to your funds and signing transactions with those keys. They offer a convenient way to sign transactions to spend your funds, while storing your keys in a safe way that prevents leaking them to others. Using a hardware wallet improves your safety by orders of magnitude in comparison to using a hot wallet on your main computer or smartphone. If you are getting started on your Bitcoin journey, you don't need to have a wallet since day one, but you probably want to obtain one once you start accumulating an amount of bitcoin that would hurt to lose. There are many hardware wallets on the market, with typical prices being around $100.\n\nAnd a final note: a balance in a centralized exchange is not a wallet. Since you don't control the keys, you are relying on and trusting the centralized exchange to actually hold your bitcoin. If, for any reason, they do not send it to you when you decide to withdraw, there is no way for you to get hold of it. Remember: not your keys, not your coins.
academy.wallets.howToPickHeadline=How to pick a wallet
academy.wallets.howToPickContent=Choosing the right wallet for you is a decision that depends on many factors, such as how you are going to use Bitcoin, what amounts you will be handling, or what devices you own. Nevertheless, there are a few general recommendations that you can follow and specific wallets that have a good track record.\n\nThe first and most important general advice is to pick an open source wallet. Ensuring your wallet's code is verifiable is paramount. You can learn more about this in the Open Source section of Bisq Learn. Another important recommendation is to pick a wallet that doesn't support other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin. Wallets that handle multiple cryptocurrencies need to use more complex code to work with the different supported currencies, which introduces bigger security risks. Hence, it is better to choose a Bitcoin-only wallet for your funds. Finally, try to look for wallets that have been around for a while, have strong user bases and have a good reputation. It is best to leave brand-new wallets for advanced usage or experiments at most.\n\nIf you plan on using your wallet on your smartphone, we advise looking into one of the following wallets: Bluewallet, Blockstream Green or Nunchuk. On the other hand, if you want to use a PC, we would suggest using one of the following: Sparrow, Bluewallet, Electrum, Blockstream Green or Nunchuk. These are all good wallets for beginners. You can try several of them to find which one suits you better, or even use multiple ones simultaneously if you want to. As you acquire more experience and knowledge, you might start developing preferences depending on the more advanced features that make these wallets a bit different from each other.\n\nOnce you have enough funds to start taking security even more seriously, it will probably make sense to acquire a hardware wallet. With a hardware wallet, you will be able to store your keys in it and sign transactions with it, while you can still use a software like Sparrow, Bluewallet or Nunchuk to read your balances and prepare transactions. When it comes to hardware wallets, most of the same advice applies: pick wallets that have transparent and public designs, that only support Bitcoin and that have a good reputation and track record. Some well-known brands are Coldcard, Bitbox, Trezor or Foundation.\n\nThe world of wallets is rich and diverse, which is both great and confusing. It's perfectly fine to be a bit overwhelmed at first. If you are just starting out, we would advise researching a bit, trying on some of the options we have shared with you, and, once you find one with which you feel comfortable, stick to it. As you keep learning more about Bitcoin, you can always explore new and more advanced options and switch to any other wallet, or use multiple of them, whenever you like.

## Free Open Source Software
######################################################

academy.foss.subHeadline=Learn about open source software and how e dey power Bitcoin and Bisq
academy.foss.bitcoinAndFossHeadline=Bitcoin and open source software
academy.foss.bitcoinAndFossContent=Open source software is software for which the code is publicly accessible and anyone can read, copy and modify that code in any way they see fit. This is in contrast with closed-source or proprietary software, where the original author decides to keep the code to himself and no one else has access or permission to it. Even though this might feel like a technical topic, it is in your interest to understand the implications of open source software on your Bitcoin journey. Let's dive into it.\n\nThe world of Bitcoin is deeply influenced by and related to open source software. The Bitcoin software itself has been open source since day one. Bisq is also an open source project. Many other surrounding technologies, like Lightning clients, mixing services or mining firmware, are typically built as open source projects. Many wallets are also open source, and as we discuss in the Wallets section of Bisq Learn, we heavily recommend that you pick wallets that are open source.\n\nWhy is this so? Closed source software is usually built and kept private by companies and individuals that want to charge others for licenses and keep full control of the project. In the Bitcoin space, this is rarely the case. Bitcoin is an open and welcoming system by nature, and the code is a representation of this. Anyone can see the code, modify it, share copies of their own version with others, and, put simply, do as he pleases with it. Bisq is also an open source project where everyone is welcome to participate, expand the application, and make improvements in different ways.
academy.foss.openSourceBenefitsHeadline=How open source dey benefit you
academy.foss.openSourceBenefitsContent=You fit think say, since you no be software developer, whether the code ofsome software na public or not no too consign you. This one no correct at all. Even if you no plan to look ormodify the code of the apps wey you dey use, your experience with am go deeply affected by whether the code deyopen or closed source. This one dey even more important when we dey talk about the software wey go run yourfinancial life and support your ability to save, receive, and send money. Generally, using open source softwarego benefit you pass using closed source equivalents. Make we break down some important reasons wey make amimportant for you.\n\nOne very important reason to choose open source software na security. Since open sourcesoftware fit be read by anybody, hackers and bad actors dey regularly find errors and security holes inside am.You fit think say e dey dangerous, but e dey the other way round! This one na because the code wey e open toeverybody means say anybody fit find security issues and either point am out, fix am themselves, or exploitam for bad purpose. Collectively, the community of users and developers around the project fit spot and fixmost errors quickly, sometimes even before dem release am. And if person use the error for bad purpose toexploit the software, e no go tey before dem notice am and find solution. For closed source software,only the small, paid team wey dey behind the project dey review the code, wey translate to say e get higherchance for errors to go unnoticed. More eyes, fewer bugs. And companies too get incentive to no reveal the factsay their closed source products get security issues, wey cause plenty bugs and hacks wey dem dey keep secretinstead of dey disclose am. Lastly, since for closed source projects, only the developing team fit see thecode, how you or anybody fit dey fully confident say the software dey safe? This one relate to one commonsaying for Bitcoin culture: no trust, verify. Overall, open source software dey lead to much more secure androbust results pass closed source software.\n\nAnother great reason to choose open source software passclosed source na for the long term. Code wey dey public no depend on any single entity or individual todey maintain am over time. Even if the original team behind the project disappear one day, others fit takeover and continue to maintain and evolve am. The biggest example na Bitcoin itself: even though thepseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappear more than ten years ago, the project still dey grow anddey flourish beyond all expectations. So, anytime wey you choose open source software pass closed source,you dey dramatically reduce the chance say some company or developer go leave you dey use some software weyno dey maintained and e go fade and become outdated.\n\nLast last, open source projects wey people deyuse well, like Bitcoin, Bisq, or wallets like Electrum, dey attract the best talent and lead to high-qualityproducts. The open nature of the projects allow anybody to collaborate, and many great developers for the spacego prefer to collaborate by building on top of better project instead of start duplicate effort from scratch.Over time, the contributions from these people dey lead to impressive results wey dey often pass wetin mostcompanies, even the ones wey get plenty money, fit achieve.\n\nTo sum up, choose open source options foryour Bitcoin tools come with plenty advantages wey go help you enjoy safe and useful products of high quality.We dey hope say you go dey curious about the nature of the code wey you dey use for your daily life and yougo dey make informed choices over the software wey you dey run.
