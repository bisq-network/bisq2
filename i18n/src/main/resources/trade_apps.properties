tradeApps.overview.subHeadline=A trade protocol serves as the fundamental framework for trading Bitcoin in a secure way. \
  Each trade protocol presents its own set of advantages and trade-offs encompassing security, privacy, and convenience.\n\
  Bisq offers you the flexibility to select the optimal protocol aligning with your preferences.\n\n\
  Explore the upcoming trade protocols slated for integration into Bisq. \
  As of now, Bisq Easy stands as the sole implemented protocol, tailored for novice Bitcoin users and suitable for smaller trade amounts. \
  Keep an eye out for updates if any of the upcoming protocols catch your interest.

tradeApps.overview.more=Additionally, there are more protocols on the horizon, scheduled for future implementation.

# suppress inspection "UnusedProperty"
tradeApps.BISQ_MU_SIG.overview=Conceptually it follows the trade protocol used in Bisq 1, based on a security deposit and a dispute resolution process.\n\
  - It reduces the number of transactions from 4 to 1.\n\
  - Improves privacy by making the deposit transaction look like a standard 'pay-to-pubKey-hash' transaction.\n\
  - It avoids the problem that a seller needs to open arbitration in case the buyer does not release the security deposit after the trade. \
  Atomic swaps will ensure the seller can get their deposit back even without cooperation of the buyer.\n\
  - In case of a non-responsive trade peer, a multi-stage payout transaction structure ensures that no arbitration \
  and reimbursement by the DAO is required.\n\
  - Taproot provides more flexibility and privacy.\n\
  - Find out more details at: https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues/456

Though those various drawbacks can be mitigated by using payment methods which carry low chargeback risk, are fast or instant and use account IDs or email instead of real names. Certain payment methods avoid banking system completely like cash-by-mail or trading face to face.

tradeApps.BISQ_LIGHTNING.overview=It enables that traders can use their off-chain Bitcoin on Lightning for trading with Fiat based on the Liquid MuSig protocol. \
  The protocol is a chain of 3 trades and 2 different protocols:\n\
  - First the traders swap their Lightning Bitcoin via a reverse Submarine swap to L-BTC (Submarine swap between Lightning and Liquid). This swap happens with any liquidity provider, not with the trading peer.\n\
  - Then the trade happens on Liquid using the MuSig protocol.\n\
  - Once the trade has completed, the L-BTC gets swapped back to Lightning by a Submarine swap (again with another trader/liquidity provider).

# suppress inspection "UnusedProperty"
tradeApps.LIQUID_SWAP.subHeadline=Atomic swap based trade protocol on the Liquid side-chain for trading any Liquid asset
# suppress inspection "UnusedProperty"
tradeApps.LIQUID_SWAP.overview=To use Liquid swaps the user need to install and run the Elements wallet and configure it, so that it can be accessed from the Bisq application.\n\n\
  The most widely used asset on Liquid is USDT (Tether), a stable coin pegged to the USD. While this is not comparable to something like Bitcoin, it has many advantages over Fiat USD which involves usually bank transfers with all the problems and inconvenience of the legacy Fiat system.\n\n\
  L-BTC might be used on the other end of the trade which is a substitute of Bitcoin on the Liquid chain. To convert Bitcoin to L-BTC one need to send Bitcoin to a  peg-in address and will receive after 102 confirmations L-BTC for that. Going back from L-BTC to Bitcoin (peg-out)  works similar but requires authorisation from the Liquid federation which is a group of companies and individuals in the Bitcoin space. So it is not a completely trust-less process.\n\n\
  One should avoid comparing Liquid assets to the properties of Bitcoin. It targets other use cases and cannot meet the high level of decentralisation and censorship resistance of Bitcoin. It can be seen rather as an alternative to traditional financial products. By using blockchain technology it avoids classical intermediaries, improves security and privacy and provides a better user experience.
