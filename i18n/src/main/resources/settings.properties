  If one network is affected by a DDoS attack, Bisq can continue operating through the other, ensuring uninterrupted communication.

  The router may be flagged as unreliable by the I2P network.\n\n\
  To avoid these issues, you can either install the official I2P router from https://geti2p.net or use the Bisq I2P Router, \
  which continues running after Bisq is closed. This provides faster startup times and, depending on your network setup, \
  allows your router to contribute more effectively to the I2P network.
