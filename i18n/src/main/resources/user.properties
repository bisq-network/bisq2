# Reputation
################################################################################

user.reputation.headline=How to build up reputation
user.reputation.info=For Bitcoin sellers it's important to provide reputation to the buyer, because the buyer will send \
  the fiat amount first and need a reason why they should trust the seller.\n\
  Gaining reputation is intended for experienced Bisq users who are familiar with Bisq.\n\n\
  There are multiple options how to provide reputation:\n\n\
  1. Burning BSQ\n\
  2. Setting up a BSQ bond\n\
  3. Importing the account age from a Bisq 1 account\n\
  4. Importing the signed account age witness from a Bisq 1 account

user.reputation.source.BURNED_BSQ=Burned BSQ
user.reputation.source.BSQ_BOND=Bonded BSQ
user.reputation.source.PROFILE_AGE=Profile age
user.reputation.source.BISQ1_ACCOUNT_AGE=Account age

user.reputation.weight=Weight
user.reputation.score=Score
user.reputation.ageScore=Age score

user.reputation.burnBsq=Burning BSQ
user.reputation.burnedBsq.tab1=Why
user.reputation.burnedBsq.tab2=Score
user.reputation.burnedBsq.tab3=How-to
user.reputation.burnedBsq.infoHeadline=Skin in the game
user.reputation.burnedBsq.info=By burning BSQ you provide evidence that you invested money into your reputation.\n\
  The burn BSQ transaction contains the hash of the public key of your profile. \
  In case of malicious behaviour your profile might get banned by mediators and with that your investment into your reputation would become worthless.
user.reputation.burnedBsq.infoHeadline2=What is the recommended amount to burn?
user.reputation.burnedBsq.info2=That will be determined by the competition of sellers. The sellers with the highest reputation score will have better \
  trade opportunities and can get a higher price premium. The top 3 offers ranked by reputation will get promoted in the 'Buy Bitcoin' screen.\n\n\
  Amounts below 20 BSQ may not provide the minimum level of security required to build up trust with a buyer (this also depends on the market and traded amounts).\n\n\
  If burning BSQ is undesirable, consider the other available options for building up reputation.
user.reputation.burnedBsq.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
user.reputation.burnedBsq.score.info=Burning BSQ is considered the strongest form of reputation which is represented by the high weight factor. \
  The burned BSQ linearly decays to zero over a period of 30 days. \
  Periodical burning of smaller amounts represents a continuous long term engagement.\n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

user.reputation.burnedBsq.score=Burned BSQ amount * decay factor
user.reputation.burnedBsq.ageScore=Amount * age in days
user.reputation.burnedBsq.totalScore=Score * weight + age score

user.reputation.burnedBsq.howToHeadline=Process for burning BSQ
user.reputation.burnedBsq.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'DAO/PROOF OF BURN' and paste the copied value into the 'pre-image' field.\n\     \
  Enter the amount of BSQ you want to burn.\n\
  4. Publish the Burn BSQ transaction.\n\
  5. After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile.

user.reputation.bond=BSQ bonds
user.reputation.bond.tab1=Why
user.reputation.bond.tab2=Score
user.reputation.bond.tab3=How-to
user.reputation.bond.infoHeadline=Skin in the game
user.reputation.bond.info=By setting up a BSQ bond you provide evidence that you locked up money for gaining reputation.\n\
  The BSQ bond transaction contains the hash of the public key of your profile. \
  In case of malicious behaviour your bond could get confiscated by the DAO and your profile might get banned by mediators.
user.reputation.bond.infoHeadline2=What is the recommended amount and lock time?
user.reputation.bond.info2=The lock time need to be at least 10000 blocks which is about 70 days to be considered a valid bond. \
  The amount can be chosen by the user and will determine together with the lock time the ranking to other sellers. \
  The sellers with the highest reputation score will have better \
  trade opportunities and can get a higher price premium. The top 3 offers ranked by reputation will get promoted in the 'Buy Bitcoin' screen.\n\n\
  Amounts below 1000 BSQ might not provide the minimum level of security required to build up trust with a buyer (but it also depends on the market and traded amounts).\n\n\
  If a BSQ bond is too much of a hassle, consider the other available options for building up reputation.
user.reputation.bond.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
user.reputation.bond.score.info=Setting up a BSQ bond is considered a strong form of reputation which is represented by the weight factor. \
  Min lock time: 10000 blocks (about 70 days)\n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

user.reputation.bond.score=Bonded BSQ amount * lock time / 10000
user.reputation.bond.ageScore=Score * age in days
user.reputation.bond.totalScore=Score * weight + age score

user.reputation.bond.howToHeadline=Process for setting up a BSQ bond
user.reputation.bond.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'DAO/BONDING/BONDED REPUTATION' and paste the copied value into the 'salt' field.\n\     \
  Enter the amount of BSQ you want to lock up and the lock time (min. 10000 blocks).\n\
  4. Publish the lockup transaction.\n\
  5. After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile.

user.reputation.accountAge.tab3=How-to
user.reputation.accountAge.infoHeadline=Provide trust
user.reputation.accountAge.info=By linking your Bisq 1 'account age' you can provide some level of trust.\n\n\
  There are some reasonable expectations that a user who has used Bisq for some time is an honest user. But \
  that expectation is weak compared to other forms of reputation where the user provides stronger proof with \
  the use of some financial resources.
user.reputation.accountAge.infoHeadline2=Privacy implications
user.reputation.accountAge.info2=Linking your Bisq 1 account with Bisq 2 has some implications on your privacy. \
  For verifying your 'account age' your Bisq 1 identity gets cryptographically linked to your Bisq 2 profile ID.\n\
  Though, the exposure is limited to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' which is operated by a Bisq contributor who has set up a \
  BSQ bond (bonded role).\n\n\
  Account age is an alternative for those who do not want to use burned BSQ or BSQ bonds due to the financial \
  cost. The 'account age' should be at least several months old to reflect some level of trust.
user.reputation.accountAge.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
user.reputation.accountAge.score.info=Importing 'account age' is considered a rather weak form of reputation which is \
  represented by the low weight factor.\n\
  There is a cap of 1 year for the score calculation.\n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

user.reputation.accountAge.totalScore=Account age in days (max. 365) * weight

user.reputation.accountAge.howToHeadline=Process for importing your 'account age' from Bisq 1
user.reputation.accountAge.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'ACCOUNT/NATIONAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS'. Select your oldest account and click the 'EXPORT ACCOUNT AGE' button. \
  This will create a signature with the given data and copies the result to the clipboard.\n\
  4. Go back to Bisq 2 and click the 'Request authorization' button. This sends the data to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' for verification and publishing.\n\
  5. After a short delay your 'account age' should be visible in your reputation score.

user.reputation.signedWitness.tab3=How-to
user.reputation.signedWitness.infoHeadline=Provide trust
user.reputation.signedWitness.info=By linking your Bisq 1 'signed account age witness' you can provide some level of trust.\n\n\
  There are some reasonable expectations that a user who has traded a while back on Bisq 1 and got signed their account is an honest user. But \
  that expectation is weak compared to other forms of reputation where the user provides more "skin in the game" with \
  the use of financial resources.
user.reputation.signedWitness.infoHeadline2=Privacy implications
user.reputation.signedWitness.info2=Linking your Bisq 1 account with Bisq 2 has some implications on your privacy. \
  For verifying your 'signed account age witness' your Bisq 1 identity gets cryptographically linked to your Bisq 2 profile ID.\n\
  Though, the exposure is limited to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' which is operated by a Bisq contributor who has set up a \
  BSQ bond (bonded role).\n\n\
  Signed account age witness is an alternative for those who don't want to use burned BSQ or BSQ bonds due to the financial \
  burden. The 'signed account age witness' has to be at least 61 days old to be considered for reputation.
user.reputation.signedWitness.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
user.reputation.signedWitness.score.info=Importing 'signed account age witness' is considered a weak form of reputation which is represented by the weight factor. The 'signed account age witness' has to be at least 61 days old and there is a cap of 1 year for the score calculation. \n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

user.reputation.signedWitness.totalScore=Witness-age in days (min. 61, max. 365) * weight

user.reputation.signedWitness.howToHeadline=Process for importing your 'signed account age witness' from Bisq 1
user.reputation.signedWitness.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'ACCOUNT/NATIONAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS'. Select your oldest signed account and click the 'EXPORT SIGNED WITNESS' button. \
  This will create a signature with the given data and copies the result to the clipboard.\n\
  4. Go back to Bisq 2 and click the 'Request authorization' button. This sends the data to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' for verification and publishing.\n\
  5. After a short delay your 'signed account age witness' should be visible in your reputation score.

user.reputation.request=Request authorization

user.bondedRoles.type.MEDIATOR.about.info=If there are conflicts in a Bisq Easy trade the traders can request help from a mediator.\n\
  The mediator has no enforcement power and can only try to assist in finding a cooperative resolution. In case of clear violations \
  of the trade rules or scam attempts the mediator can provide information to the moderator to ban the bad actor from the network.\n\
  Mediators and arbitrators from Bisq 1 can become Bisq 2 mediators without locking up a new BSQ bond.
user.bondedRoles.type.MODERATOR.about.info=Chat users can report violations of the chat or trade rules to the moderator.\n\
  In case the provided information is sufficient to verify a rule violation the moderator can ban that user from the network.\n\
  In case of severe violations of a seller who had earned some sort of reputation, the reputation becomes invalidated and the relevant source data \
  (like the DAO transaction or account age data) will be blacklisted in Bisq 2 and reported back to Bisq 1 by the oracle \
  operator and the user will get banned at Bisq 1 as well.

user.bondedRoles.type.SEED_NODE.about.info=A seed node provides network addresses of network participants for bootstrapping to the Bisq 2 P2P network.\n\
  This is essential at the very fist start as at that moment the new user has no persisted data yet for connecting to other peers.\n\
  It also provides P2P network data like chat messages to the freshly connecting user. \
  That data delivery service is also performed by any other network node, though as seed nodes have 24/7 availability and a high level of quality of \
  service they provide more stability and better performance, thus leading to a better bootstrap experience.\n\
  Seed node operators from Bisq 1 can become Bisq 2 seed node operators without locking up a new BSQ bond.
user.bondedRoles.type.ORACLE_NODE.about.info=The oracle node is used to provide Bisq 1 and DAO data for Bisq 2 use cases like reputation.
user.bondedRoles.type.EXPLORER_NODE.about.info=The blockchain explorer node is used in Bisq Easy for transaction lookup of the Bitcoin payment.
user.bondedRoles.type.MARKET_PRICE_NODE.about.info=The market price node provides market data from the Bisq market price aggregator.
