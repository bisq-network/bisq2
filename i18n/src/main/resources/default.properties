# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings. Those cannot be detected by IDE and 
# might show incorrectly as unused.

# An annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# Hyperlinks in popups can be added via: [HYPERLINK:https://....]. They will get displayed as enumerated footer notes.

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces.
# To make longer strings better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the string, only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to English. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that, but we want to keep effort at the minimum.

## Protocols roadmap
######################################################

trade.protocols.overview=Overview
trade.protocols.release=Release
trade.protocols.tradeOffs=Pro/Con

trade.protocols.LIQUID_SWAP.subHeadline=Atomic swap based trade protocol on the Liquid side-chain for trading any Liquid asset
trade.protocols.LIQUID_SWAP.overview=To use Liquid swaps the user need to install and run the Elements wallet and configure it, so that it can be accessed from the Bisq application.\n\n\
  The most widely used asset on Liquid is USDT (Tether) - a stable coin pegged to the USD. While this is not comparable to something like Bitcoin, it has many advantages over Fiat USD which involves usually bank transfers with all the problems and inconvenience of the legacy Fiat system.\n\n\
  L-BTC might be used on the other end of the trade which is a substitute of Bitcoin on the Liquid chain. To convert Bitcoin to L-BTC one need to send Bitcoin to a  peg-in address and will receive after 102 confirmations L-BTC for that. Going back from L-BTC to Bitcoin (peg-out)  works similar but requires authorisation from the Liquid federation which is a group of companies and individuals in the Bitcoin space. So it is not a completely trust-less process.\n\n\
  One should avoid to compare Liquid assets to the properties of Bitcoin. It targets other use cases and cannot meet the high level of decentralisation and censorship resistance of Bitcoin. It can be seen rather as an alternative to traditional financial products. By using blockchain technology it avoids classical intermediaries, improves security and privacy and provides a better user experience.
trade.protocols.LIQUID_SWAP.release=Liquid swaps are still in development. It is expected to be released in Q4/2022.
trade.protocols.LIQUID_SWAP.tradeOffs=\
  + Confidential transactions provide good privacy\n\
  + Fast confirmation time of about 1 minute\n\
  + Low transaction fees\n\
  + Suitable for high value transactions\n\n\
  - Requires running the Elements wallet and blockchain\n\
  - Both traders need to be online\n\
  - Peg-out from L-BTC is not trust-less


trade.protocols.MONERO_SWAP.subHeadline=Atomic cross-chain swap protocol for trading Bitcoin with Monero
trade.protocols.MONERO_SWAP.overview=Based on the Farcaster project (funded by the Monero community) using hashed time lock contracts (HTLC), adaptor signatures and uses zero-knowledge proof for atomically swapping Bitcoin and Monero.\n\n\
  The user need to install and run a Bitcoin node, a Monero node and the Farcaster daemon. During the swap the nodes of both traders need to be online. The extra effort when using that protocol pays off with a very high level of security. \
  Though users should make themselves familiar with the details of that concept and be aware that there are edge case carrying some small risks.
trade.protocols.MONERO_SWAP.release=Monero swaps are expected to be ready for release in Q1/2023.
trade.protocols.MONERO_SWAP.tradeOffs=\
  + Very secure\n\
  + Decent privacy. On the Bitcoin side it inherits Bitcoins privacy properties. On the Monero side it benefits from the high privacy of Monero.\n\
  + Suitable for high value transactions\n\n\
  - It requires some technical skills and experience to run the required infrastructure\n\
  - Confirmation time is based on the confirmations on both blockchains which will be usually about 20-30 min.\n\
  - Transaction fees on the Bitcoin side could be non-trivial in case of high blockchain congestion (rather rare, though)\n\
  - Both traders need to be online


trade.protocols.BISQ_MULTISIG.subHeadline=Based on a security deposit, a 2-of-2 Multisig transaction and a multi layer dispute resolution process
trade.protocols.BISQ_MULTISIG.overview=Conceptually it follows the trade protocol used in Bisq 1, though the new Bisq Multisig protocol comes with some improvements:\n\n\
  - It avoids the maker-fee and taker-fee transactions and reduces by that the total number of involved transactions to 2 (maybe even to 1, but this has to be further investigated).\n\
  - Another open research area is to replace the delayed payout transaction by using a Taproot branch.\n\
  - The most important aspect though is to replace the manual role of the burningman by a smart contract. There is still not a satisfying solution found in that area, but we hope to be able to solve that.
trade.protocols.BISQ_MULTISIG.release=Bisq Multisig is expected to be ready for release in Q2/2023.
trade.protocols.BISQ_MULTISIG.tradeOffs=\
  + Reasonable good security for medium value trade amounts\n\
  + Compared to Bisq Easy the security properties are better and higher amounts can be traded. The higher amounts bring trade prices closer to market rates.\n\
  + Manages to deal with the legacy system of the Fiat world\n\n\
  - Both traders need to have BTC for the security deposit\n\
  - The makers Bisq node need to be online as the take-offer process is interactive\n\
  - As the Fiat transfer is done on legacy systems like bank transfers it inherits all those drawbacks, like chargeback risk, slow transfer, privacy exposure to peer when the bank transfer details contain the real name. Though those various drawbacks can be mitigated by using payment methods which carry low chargeback risk, are fast or instant and use account IDs or email instead of real names. Certain payment methods avoid banking system completely like cash-by-mail or trading face to face.

trade.protocols.BSQ_SWAP.subHeadline=Atomic swap between BSQ (colored coin on Bitcoin) and Bitcoin
trade.protocols.BSQ_SWAP.overview=Same model as used in Bisq 1. As it is based on one single atomic transaction it is very secure.\n\
  It will require to run the Bisq 1 node with the DAO API enabled.
trade.protocols.BSQ_SWAP.release=BSQ swaps is expected to be ready for release in Q3/2023.
trade.protocols.BSQ_SWAP.tradeOffs=\
  + Very secure\n\
  + Relative fast, thought only after the blockchain confirmation the trade is considered complete\n\
  + No maker fee transaction and no security deposit required\n\n\
  - Need to run Bisq 1 for the BSQ/DAO data\n\
  - Limited to BSQ/BTC market


trade.protocols.LIGHTNING_X.subHeadline=3-party protocol for trading Fiat with Bitcoin on Lightning Network.
trade.protocols.LIGHTNING_X.overview=It is based on multiple Lightning payments and splits up the secrets for the HTLCs to construct a secure setup where the 3rd party guarantees that the traders behave fair. It uses garbled circuits to achieve secure multi party computation.\n\n\
  The user needs to run a Lightning node which is configured with the Bisq application.\n\n\
  Conceptually it is similar to the Bisq Multisig protocol but instead of the Multisig transaction it uses this 3-party set-up and instead of on-chain Bitcoin it uses Bitcoin on Lightning Network.
trade.protocols.LIGHTNING_X.release=Lightning-X is expected to be ready for release in Q2/2023.
trade.protocols.LIGHTNING_X.tradeOffs=\
  + Compared to Bisq Easy the security properties are better and higher amounts can be traded. The higher amounts bring trade prices closer to market rates.\n\
  + The Bitcoin payments are near instant\n\
  + Very low transaction (routing) fees\n\n\
  - Need to run a Lightning node\n\
  - Both traders need to have BTC (on Lightning) for the security deposit.\n\
  - The makers Bisq node need to be online as the take-offer process is interactive.\n\
  - As the Fiat transfer is done on legacy systems like bank transfers it inherits all those drawbacks, like chargeback risk, slow transfer, privacy exposure to peer when the bank transfer details contain the real name. Though those various drawbacks can be mitigated by using payment methods which carry low chargeback risk, are fast or instant and use account IDs or email instead of real names. Certain payment methods avoid banking system completely like cash-by-mail or trading face to face.

tradeGuide.tab1.headline=Security
tradeGuide.tab1.content=\
  - The security model of Bisq Easy is best for small trade amounts\n\
  - It's based on the reputation of the seller\n\
  - The seller is usually an experienced Bisq user and is expected to be helpful and supportive for users who are new to Bisq.\n\
  - Building up reputation can be costly. A price premium of about 10-15% is common to reflect those extra costs and to compensate for the service that the seller offers.\n\
  - By default, private messages are only accessible to sellers with a certain level of reputation, but users can opt-out from that protection.\n\
  - Trading with sellers without reputation carries significant risks and should be only done if the risks are well understood and managed.

tradeGuide.tab2.headline=Trade process
tradeGuide.tab2.content=\
  1. The offer maker defines the trade terms, if this was not already defined in the maker's user profile.\n\
  2. Once the traders have agreed on the trade terms (e.g. payment method and trade price) the trade starts.\n\
  3. The seller transmits the payment account details to the buyer (e.g. bank account number). The buyer sends the BTC address to the seller.\n\
  4. The buyer starts the Fiat payment to the sellers account and sends the seller a message that the payment is in transit.\n\
  5. Once the seller has received the Fiat payment they send the Bitcoin to the buyers address.\n\
  6. After the buyer received the Bitcoin the trade is completed.

tradeGuide.tab3.headline=Trade rules
tradeGuide.tab3.content=\
  - Before the payment details are exchanged the trade can be canceled by any party without justification.\n\
  - After the payment details are exchanged not fulfilling the trade obligations is considered a breach of the trade contract and can lead to getting banned from the network.\n\
  - When sending the Fiat the buyer MUST NOT use any term in the 'reason for payment' field which relates to 'Bisq' or 'Bitcoin'. The traders can agree on an identifier to associate the bank transfer to the trade (e.g. a random string like 'H3TJAPD').\n\
  - If the trade cannot be completed instantly because the Fiat transfer takes longer, both traders have to be online at least once a day to follow up the trade process.\n\
  - If there are any open questions or problems the traders can use the support chat, invite a mediator into their trade chat or get in touch with Bisq support team on the Matrix channel at 'https://bisq.chat'.

reputation.headline=How to build up reputation
reputation.info=
  For Bitcoin sellers it's important to provide reputation to the buyer, because the buyer will send \
  the fiat amount first and need a reason why they should trust the seller.\n\
  Gaining reputation is intended for experienced Bisq users who are familiar with Bisq.\n\n\
  There are multiple options how to provide reputation:\n\n\
  1. Burning BSQ\n\
  2. Setting up a BSQ bond\n\
  3. Importing the account age from a Bisq 1 account\n\
  4. Importing the signed account age witness from a Bisq 1 account

reputation.burnedBsq.tab3=How-to
reputation.burnedBsq.infoHeadline=Skin in the game
reputation.burnedBsq.info=By burning BSQ you provide evidence that you invested money into your reputation.\n\
  The burn BSQ transaction contains the hash of the public key of your profile. \
  In case of malicious behaviour your profile might get banned by mediators and with that your investment into your reputation would become worthless.
reputation.burnedBsq.infoHeadline2=What is the recommended amount to burn?
reputation.burnedBsq.info2=That will be determined by the competition of sellers. The sellers with the highest reputation score will have better \
  trade opportunities and can get a higher price premium. The top 3 offers ranked by reputation will get promoted in the 'Buy Bitcoin' screen.\n\n\
  Amounts below 20 BSQ may not provide the minimum level of security required to build up trust with a buyer (this also depends on the market and traded amounts).\n\n\
  If burning BSQ is undesirable, consider the other available options for building up reputation.
reputation.burnedBsq.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
reputation.burnedBsq.score.info=Burning BSQ is considered the strongest form of reputation which is represented by the high weight factor. \
  The burned BSQ linearly decays to zero over a period of 30 days. \
  Periodical burning of smaller amounts represents a continuous long term engagement.\n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

reputation.burnedBsq.score=Burned BSQ amount * decay factor
reputation.burnedBsq.ageScore=Amount * age in days
reputation.burnedBsq.totalScore=Score * weight + age score

reputation.burnedBsq.howToHeadline=Process for burning BSQ
reputation.burnedBsq.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'DAO/PROOF OF BURN' and paste the copied value into the 'pre-image' field.\n\     \
  Enter the amount of BSQ you want to burn.\n\
  4. Publish the Burn BSQ transaction.\n\
  5. After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile.

reputation.bond.tab2=Score
reputation.bond.tab3=How-to
reputation.bond.infoHeadline=Skin in the game
reputation.bond.info=By setting up a BSQ bond you provide evidence that you locked up money for gaining reputation.\n\
  The BSQ bond transaction contains the hash of the public key of your profile. \
  In case of malicious behaviour your bond could get confiscated by the DAO and your profile might get banned by mediators.
reputation.bond.infoHeadline2=What is the recommended amount and lock time?
reputation.bond.info2=The lock time need to be at least 10000 blocks which is about 70 days to be considered a valid bond. \
  The amount can be chosen by the user and will determine together with the lock time the ranking to other sellers. \
  The sellers with the highest reputation score will have better \
  trade opportunities and can get a higher price premium. The top 3 offers ranked by reputation will get promoted in the 'Buy Bitcoin' screen.\n\n\
  Amounts below 1000 BSQ might not provide the minimum level of security required to build up trust with a buyer (but it also depends on the market and traded amounts).\n\n\
  If a BSQ bond is too much of a hassle, consider the other available options for building up reputation.
reputation.bond.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
reputation.bond.score.info=Setting up a BSQ bond is considered a strong form of reputation which is represented by the weight factor. \
  Min lock time: 10000 blocks (about 70 days)\n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

reputation.bond.score=Bonded BSQ amount * lock time / 10000
reputation.bond.ageScore=Score * age in days
reputation.bond.totalScore=Score * weight + age score

reputation.bond.howToHeadline=Process for setting up a BSQ bond
reputation.bond.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'DAO/BONDING/BONDED REPUTATION' and paste the copied value into the 'salt' field.\n\     \
  Enter the amount of BSQ you want to lock up and the lock time (min. 10000 blocks).\n\
  4. Publish the lockup transaction.\n\
  5. After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile.


reputation.accountAge=Account age

reputation.accountAge.tab2=Score
reputation.accountAge.tab3=How-to
reputation.accountAge.infoHeadline=Provide trust
reputation.accountAge.info=By linking your Bisq 1 'account age' you can provide some level of trust.\n\n\
  There are some reasonable expectations that a user who has used Bisq for some time is an honest user. But \
  that expectation is weak compared to other forms of reputation where the user provides stronger proof with \
  the use of some financial resources.
reputation.accountAge.infoHeadline2=Privacy implications
reputation.accountAge.info2=Linking your Bisq 1 account with Bisq 2 has some implications on your privacy. \
  For verifying your 'account age' your Bisq 1 identity gets cryptographically linked to your Bisq 2 profile ID.\n\
  Though, the exposure is limited to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' which is operated by a Bisq contributor who has set up a \
  BSQ bond (bonded role).\n\n\
  Account age is an alternative for those who do not want to use burned BSQ or BSQ bonds due to the financial \
  cost. The 'account age' should be at least several months old to reflect some level of trust.
reputation.accountAge.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
reputation.accountAge.score.info=Importing 'account age' is considered a rather weak form of reputation which is \
  represented by the low weight factor.\n\
  There is a cap of 1 year for the score calculation.\n\n\

  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'ACCOUNT/NATIONAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS'. Select your oldest account and click the 'EXPORT ACCOUNT AGE' button. \
  This will create a signature with the given data and copies the result to the clipboard.\n\
  4. Go back to Bisq 2 and click the 'Request authorization' button. This sends the data to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' for verification and publishing.\n\

reputation.signedWitness.infoHeadline=Provide trust
reputation.signedWitness.info=By linking your Bisq 1 'signed account age witness' you can provide some level of trust.\n\n\
  There are some reasonable expectations that a user who has traded a while back on Bisq 1 and got signed their account is an honest user. But \
  that expectation is weak compared to other forms of reputation where the user provides more "skin in the game" with \
  the use of financial resources. 
reputation.signedWitness.infoHeadline2=Privacy implications
reputation.signedWitness.info2=Linking your Bisq 1 account with Bisq 2 has some implications on your privacy. \
  For verifying your 'signed account age witness' your Bisq 1 identity gets cryptographically linked to your Bisq 2 profile ID.\n\
  Though, the exposure is limited to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' which is operated by a Bisq contributor who has set up a \
  BSQ bond (bonded role).\n\n\
  Signed account age witness is an alternative for those who don't want to use burned BSQ or BSQ bonds due to the financial \
  burden. The 'signed account age witness' has to be at least 61 days old to be considered for reputation.
reputation.signedWitness.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
reputation.signedWitness.score.info=Importing 'signed account age witness' is considered a weak form of reputation which is represented by the weight factor. The 'signed account age witness' has to be at least 61 days old and there is a cap of 1 year for the score calculation. \n\n\
