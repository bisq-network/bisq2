You might find it helpful to read through [this doc](./docs/motivations.md) on the motivations for Bisq v2 as well as [this doc](./docs/aims.md) which includes a comprehensive look at the aims for Bisq v2.

## Current Development State

### Network module

The network layer is already functional to a large extent. [See the spec here](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq2/blob/main/network/src/main/java/bisq/network/specification.md).

It supports:
- Multiple transport types (Clearnet, Tor, I2P)
- Peer management to build a gossip overlay network
- Distributed data storage for 4 different types of data:
  - Authenticated data (e.g. offers). Only the data creator can remove it.
  - Authorized data (e.g. filter, mediator). Similar to above, but only authorized users can publish such data (e.g. using bonded roles).
  - Mailbox messages: Only receiver can remove the data.
  - Append-only data: Only hash is used for storage. Data cannot be removed (e.g. trade statistics)
- Preparation for PoW based DoS protection (not implemented yet but the layer is already integrated)
- Sending and receiving confidential messages (encrypted, signed messages). Also supports handling of mailbox messages.
- Data retrieval at startup from other nodes

### Identity module

Work on the identity management has been started but requires more work.

An identity consists of a `domainId`, `networkId`, and `keyPair`. The `domainId` is a tag to associate the identity with some domain aspect (e.g. offer ID). The `networkId` contains network addresses for the different transport types (onion address, I2P address) and the public key. 
Because the network addresses are only known after the server has started (e.g. hidden service is published) we have to deal with some delay when creating a new identity (takes about 4 sec. for Tor). To avoid this UX degradation, we use a pool of identities which are initialized at startup, so when the client requests a new identity we take one from the pool, and it is ready to be used without delay. 

What is missing is a way to manage the selection of identities. A user can define different strategies:
- use a new identity for each interaction (e.g. each offer has its isolated identity)
- group interactions to one identity (e.g. all altcoin trades use the same identity)
- use one global identity (as it is in Bisq v1)  

### Desktop module
The current UI prototype comes with a simple offer message board (Social/Trade Intent) and a chat (Social/Hangout).
In Settings/Network there is information about the network (connections, nodes).

Currently, one peer can publish an offer intent, and another peer can contact the maker peer and start a chat with them. The purpose here is mainly to test the network with more realistic use cases. It is not clear yet if this example use-case will get developed further for production or if it will be dropped.

### Offer, Contract, Protocol modules
These modules are implemented for some demo trade protocols (2-of-2 multisig, BSQ bond-based, LN-based) but there is no integration yet with real wallets (ubut note that the network integration works already, so the demo protocols send real messages between the trade peers). It is all still in a very preliminary state and will require much more work to get closer to some production-level version. 

Once we have a Liquid wallet integration, we will probably focus on an atomic swap USDT-BTC on Liquid, as that seems to be one of the easier protocol types.

A reputation-based protocol can also be implemented without a full wallet integration, but this will require more work on the identity and chat domains.

### Social module
The social module manages chat use-cases. User management is not implemented yet. Public chat channels are also not implemented yet. 


## Running the Prototype

Currently, you need to start the Desktop app from the IntelliJ IDE and not via gradle as there are some open issues with the JFoenix library we are currently using (might get replaced with Gluon).

You can right-click the `bisq.desktop.Main` class in the desktop module to create a run config or create a `run config` in `Run/Edi Configurations`. You need to add the JVM argument: `--add-opens java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED` (due the JFoenix issue with Java 16).

If you want to use the network, you can start the `bisq.tools.network.monitor.MultiNodesMain` application, which starts up several seed nodes and normal nodes to build up a P2P network. 
To start with a minimal set of 2 seeds and 2 normal nodes in clearnet (localhost) use the program argument:
`--bootstrapAll=true`
If you want to run it with clearnet, Tor, and I2P use:
`--bootstrapAll=true --transports=CLEAR,TOR,I2P`.

The desktop app also requires JVM args (the typesafe config lib we use does not support overriding program args, so you have to use JVM args).
- For clearnet use
`--add-opens java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED -Dbisq.networkServiceConfig.supportedTransportTypes.0=CLEAR`

- For clearnet, Tor, and I2P use
`--add-opens java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED -Dbisq.networkServiceConfig.supportedTransportTypes.0=CLEAR -Dbisq.networkServiceConfig.supportedTransportTypes.1=TOR -Dbisq.networkServiceConfig.supportedTransportTypes.2=I2P`

When you use I2P, you need to install I2P and start the router application. The web console opens automatically. There you  need to navigate to [Clients](http://127.0.0.1:7657/configclients) and start the `SAM application bridge`. It will take about 2 minutes to be ready.

### Example Run Configurations

Here are three IntelliJ IDEA run configurations for simulating a clearnet setup locally:

| Run Config                  | MultiNodesMain                              |
