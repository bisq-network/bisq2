Open tasks:

- test all scenarios with server variants and api modes if authn and authz is done
- persist all relevant data
- separate transport and api level filtering
- add permissions for WS topics
- Maybe remove deny/allow list as redundant with permissions
- Once TLS is added make signature based auth optional as not needed anymore. Reflect this in config.
- Add authorizationRequired flag to config and rename authRequired to authenticationRequired
- show WS connection state in network state box in left bottom area
